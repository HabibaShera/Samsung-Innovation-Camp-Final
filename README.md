# RSNA 2022 Cervical Spine Fracture Detection

The goal of this project is to identify fractures in CT 
scans of the cervical spine (neck) at both the level of a 
single vertebrae and the entire patient. 
Quickly detecting and determining the location of any vertebral 
fractures is essential to prevent neurologic deterioration and 
paralysis after trauma.

## Data Overview

Every year, around the world, between 250 000 and 500 000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI).

The majority of spinal cord injuries are due to preventable causes such as road traffic crashes, falls or violence.

People with a spinal cord injury are two to five times more likely to die prematurely than people without a spinal cord injury, with worse survival rates in low- and middle-income countries.

Spinal cord injury is associated with lower rates of school enrollment and economic participation, and it carries substantial individual and societal costs.

Spinal cord injury is associated with a risk of developing secondary conditions that can be debilitating and even life-threatening. deep vein thrombosis, urinary tract infections, muscle spasms, osteoporosis, pressure ulcers, chronic pain, and respiratory complications. Acute care, rehabilitation services and ongoing health maintenance are essential for prevention and management of these conditions.
The Dataset is collected imaging data sourced from twelve sites on six continents, including approximately 3,000 CT studies. Spine radiology specialists from the ASNR and ASSR provided expert image level annotations these studies to indicate the presence, vertebral level and location of any cervical spine fractures.
